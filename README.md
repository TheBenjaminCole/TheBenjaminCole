# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thebenjamincole/">Benjamin Cole</a> - IT & Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

Welcome. This portfolio showcases hands-on projects focused on cybersecurity, cloud security, and security operations, with an emphasis on practical implementation, documentation, and real-world relevance.

My work reflects a strong interest in vulnerability management, threat detection, automation, and defensive security engineering. Each project is designed to demonstrate not just tools, but thinking: risk prioritization, security trade-offs, and operational impact.
